<!-- ABOUT THE repository -->
## About The repository

This repository serves as a record of all the files and projects completed during The Tech Academy's Python course. Below are programs and modules that iv used within the course. I have a beginning knowledge base to which I can expand my knowledge. At this point in time I can get a set of instructions and then work on accomplishing them by incorporating what I do know and through research of anything I don't know.

## Built With
These tools comprise the majority of what was used to make the programs held within this repository.

## Projects

### RidleyVerse
The Ridleyverse is a collection of movies that share a common universe. The program works as a website and uses html, CSS, Django, BeautifulSoup, and Python. Block tags are used to link each html file to create a whole site.
The purpose is to create a master list of movies form the connected Ridleyverse. There is a form to enter the details of the movies such as film name, director, actors, plot. The movies are stored in a database. The Full Story button calls a BS function that pulls \<p\> tags from a list on IMDB, (link below). It then concentrates all of the text into a full block containing the entire story of the RidleyVerse as well as how each film is connected. I chose the Ridleyverse as my topic but this program could be applied to any number of film series. It could also be a master list of movies that could have a personal review section to store you persona opinion on the movie. It's like a media manager in a way.

### File Transfer Program
  This program allows the use to specify the directory's for a start point and destination. Then with a click the user can copy all files created or modified within 24 hours from   the start folder to the destination folder.
